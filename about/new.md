# How this website was built

This website was built using software and platforms provided by others. Here's a list of them, with the foundations at the bottom and the "higher" levels at the top.

At the time of writing, all these are open source and/or free versions of services. (Most of the services offer paid versions with additional features.)
* [https://kramdown.gettalong.org/](kramdown), a superset of Markdown used for this website
* [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](Markdown), the simple coding for text to implement HTML formatting ([https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet](Cheatsheet); [https://www.markdownguide.org/](Learning Markdown))
* Some [https://www.w3schools.com/html](HTML) was required to create the basic structure...
* ...and so was some [https://www.w3schools.com/css/](CSS)
* (but most of the spadework was done by using a [http://themes.jekyllrc.org](Jekyll Theme); I cautiously chose to use one of the [https://pages.github.com/themes/](GitHub Pages Supported Themes))
* [https://jekyllrb.com](Jekyll), which converts plain text to HTML. This may be the most technical bit. You can sorta-kinda get away with working in a browser, in the GitHub website, but you'll probably need to install the software and use the command line.
* [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/](Ruby), the software that drives Jekyll. Don't panic, there's no need to learn (in fact, no opportunity) to code.
* [https://pages.github.com/](GitHub Pages), the online documentation subset of GitHub
* [https://github.com/](GitHub), the online/cloud version of Git (now owned by [https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/](Microsoft)) -- and it now calls itself a "software development platform"
* ["https://git-scm.com/](Git), the leading, unpretentious version control system

I haven't yet worked out whether there is any opportunity for (or point in) using Javascript.

## *Not* all my own work...

I used these guides in setting this up:
* [*Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub*][creating], possibly the best one-page introduction to Jekyll-based website creation, by Jonathan McGlone
* [Jekyll's excellent documentation][jekyll]
* [A Jekyll "cheat sheet"][cheat]
* [*Get Started With GitHub Pages* by Anna Debenham][getstarted]
* [*A guide to using Github Pages* by Thinkful][guideghp]
* [GitHub's own help for GitHub Pages][ghphelp]
* [*Resources to learn Git*][ghpresources]
* I will be using images. GitHub Pages focuses on text, so I found this guide on [*How to Style Images With Markdown*][styleimages] particularly useful.
