	<h1>How this website was built</h1>
	<p>This website was built using software and platforms provided by others. Here's a list of them, with the foundations at the bottom and the "higher" levels at the top.</p>
	<p>At the time of writing, all these are open source and/or free versions of services. (Most of the services offer paid versions with additional features.)</p>
	<ul>	
		<li><a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/">kramdown</a>, a superset of Markdown used for this website</li>
		<li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, the simple coding for text to implement HTML formatting (<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Cheatsheet</a>; <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Learning Markdown</a>)</li>
		<li>Some <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a> was required to create the basic structure...</li>
		<li>...and so was some <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a></li>
		<li>(most of the spadework was done by using a <a href="http://themes.jekyllrc.org/">Jekyll Theme</a>, though I chose to use one of the <a href="https://pages.github.com/themes/">GitHub Pages Supported Themes</a>)</li>
		<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, which converts plain text to HTML. This may be the most technical bit. You can sorta-kinda get away with working in a browser, in the GitHub website, but you'll probably need to install the software and use the command line.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, the software that drives Jekyll. Don't panic, there's no need to learn (in fact, no opportunity) to code.</li>
		<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, the online documentation subset of GitHub</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the online/cloud version of Git (now owned by <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/">Microsoft</a>) -- and it now calls itself a "software development platform"</li>
		<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, the leading, unpretentious version control system</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><em>Not</em> all my own work...</h2>
	<p>I used these guides in setting this up:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"><em>Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</em></a>, possibly the best one-page introduction to Jekyll-based website creation, by Jonathan McGlone</li>
		<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll's excellent documentation</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll-cheat-sheet/">A Jekyll "cheat sheet"</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/"><em>Get Started With GitHub Pages</em> by Anna Debenham</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/"><em>A guide to using Github Pages</em> by Thinkful</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://help.github.com/en/categories/github-pages-basics">GitHub's own help for GitHub Pages</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://try.github.io/"><em>Resources to learn Git</em></a></li>
		<li>I will be using images. GitHub Pages focuses on text, so I found this guide on <a href="https://www.xaprb.com/blog/how-to-style-images-with-markdown/"><em>How to Style Images With Markdown</em></a> particularly useful</li>
	</ul>
