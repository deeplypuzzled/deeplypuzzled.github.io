# How this website was built

This website was built using software and platforms provided by others. Here's a list of them, with the foundations at the bottom and the "higher" levels at the top.

At the time of writing, all these are open source and/or free versions of services. (Most of the services offer paid versions with additional features.)
* [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/), a superset of Markdown used for this website
* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), the simple coding for text to implement HTML formatting ([Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet); [*Learning Markdown*](https://www.markdownguide.org/))
* Some [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html) was required to create the basic structure...
* ...and so was some [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
* (but most of the spadework was done by using a [Jekyll Theme](http://themes.jekyllrc.org); I cautiously chose to use one of the [GitHub Pages Supported Themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/))
* [Jekyll(https://jekyllrb.com]), which converts plain text (and Markdown/kramdown) to HTML. This may be the most technical bit. You can sorta-kinda get away with working in a browser, in the GitHub website, but you'll probably need to install the software and use the command line.
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), the software that drives Jekyll. Don't panic, there's no need to learn (in fact, almost no opportunity) to code.
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the online documentation subset of GitHub
* [GitHub](https://github.com/), the online/cloud version of Git (acquired by [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/) in 2018); it now calls itself a "software development platform"
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the leading, unpretentious version control system

I haven't yet worked out whether there is any opportunity for (or point in) using Javascript. However, I am [experimenting with Bootstrap](bootstrap_test.html).

## *Not* all my own work...

I used these guides in setting this up:
* [*Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub*][creating], possibly the best one-page introduction to Jekyll-based website creation, by Jonathan McGlone
* [Jekyll's excellent documentation][jekyll]
* [A Jekyll "cheat sheet"][cheat]
* [*Get Started With GitHub Pages* by Anna Debenham][getstarted]
* [*A guide to using Github Pages* by Thinkful][guideghp]
* [GitHub's own help for GitHub Pages][ghphelp]
* [*Resources to learn Git*][ghpresources]
* I will be using images. GitHub Pages focuses on text, so I found this guide on [*How to Style Images With Markdown*][styleimages] particularly useful.
