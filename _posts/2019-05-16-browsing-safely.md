# Browsing safely

This post describes how I have set up my computer and software to minimise my footprint on the Internet and make it more useable, most of the time. *This guide covers desktop and laptop computers, not tablets and phones.*

**Disclaimer:** your mileage may vary, I am not a lawyer (or a specialist in anything in particular), I don't work with anything very secret (except my own personal information), do your own research, don't blame me.

**Caution:** some of this will break stuff, in the sense that it will stop some "clever" stuff on the Interweb working on your computer and/or in your browser. *That's the point!* -- lots of the "clever" stuff, especially scripts, is there to track you, show ads etc.

**Tradeoffs:** you'll have to do some work to set this up, and doing some things on the Internet will be a bit more complicated. Buying things online, for example. Also, some very good websites depend on advertising to cover their costs: are you OK with taking the bread from their mouths? But you are giving them and their advertisers some (or a lot) of personal information, as the price of admission: are you OK with that. As with so many things in life, you have to work out your own answers to questiins like these.

## Basic setup

### Operating system

* **Windows** has nearly 90% of the installed base of desktops and laptops.[^1] If you're not on Windows 10, you should upgrade. Keeping up with all the security updates is a challenge, but it's not optional. The same applies to using Windows Defender for virus protection.

* If you have a **Mac**, chances are that you'll be using Apple's **macOS**. Mac users are often surpised to hear that Apple has less than 10% of the installed base. Keep macOS updated and upgraded and you'll mostly be OK. Antivirus software is available, but it may be overkill.

* Of the other operating systems, only **Linux** (2%) has more than 0.3%. Use a LTS (long-term support) version and update it regularly.

### Software and add-ons

For the purpose of this guide, the key software is the web browser and its add-ons/extensions, especially its search engine. 

#### Choosing a web browser

Browser options include:
* Google's Chrome (64%-72% share)[^2]
* Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Edge (together 7%-14%)
* Mozilla's Firefox (7%-9%)
* Apple's Safari (4%-14%)
* Chinese-owned Opera (2%-3%)
* Others (2%-6% combined)

[**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) is my choice: not proprietary, no commercial axe to grind, open source, actively developed with many available add-ons.

#### Web browser settings

#### Choosing a search engine

The next task is to avoid tracking of your searches. Google has 93% of the search market![^3] Microsoft's Bing and Yahoo! have most of the rest. DuckDuckGo gets a good press, but has irritating (to me) limitations; I use [**Startpage**](https://www.startpage.com).

When I can't avoid using a proprietary service -- for example, I have to log into Google for a particular service that is not available elsewhere -- I routinely log out as soon as I finish using it.

**Warning:** you probably know this already, but most virus infections start with clicking on a link in an email. It looks oh-so-plausible!
