# Guide to Markdown and kramdown

This page is a quick reference to Markdown and kramdown. I have put *my* most-used features at the top, with more-complex elements lower down. I have left out obscure and little-used (by me) features -- that's what the docs are for! Examples are included.

## Headings

Simple: use hashes (\#) -- one \# for a top-level H1 heading, to six \###### for H6

###### Example: this is a lowest-level, H6 heading

## Emphasis

For italics (light emphasis), use a single asterisk or underscore at start and end; for bold (strong emphasis), use two asterisks or underscores. 

Example: \*italic\* &#8594; *italic*; \*\*bold\*\* &#8594; **bold**
\*\*\*bold italics\*\*\* &#8594; ***bold***
\_\_underlined\_\_ &#8594; __underlined__
